I have used Datastax to connect to database and to generate the token and bundle and downloaded the files. I used google collab and uploaded the raw data which is given for the assignment and the downloaded files to connect to the database. Then i installed Cassandra in google collab and compiled the codes so that we extract the raw data and to generate the silver, bronze, gold tables using python and CQL. I have uploaded the .ipynb file and the screenshots of the tables.
